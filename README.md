Getting And Cleaning Data Johns Hopkins Coursera Project

This has the following main files:

ProjeReadMe.RMD -- The Final Class Project readme file this explains how I did what I did
ProjCodeBook.RMD -- Explains the Variables I chose to use (not all, just some std-dev and means)
getdata_proj_tidy_final -- This is the tidy data file that I wrote out after running through all the steps in run_analysis.R
run_analysis.R -- This is the actual R commands I used to create the tidy data set. It has to be in the Root of the unzipped Data directory.
